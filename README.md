To-Do List Web Application

Overview

 This is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The application uses HTML for the structure CSS for styling and JavaScript for the dynamic behavior. Task data is stored in the browser's localStorage to persist tasks even after reloading the page.

Features

 Add Task: Enter a task in the input box and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.

Mark as Completed: Click on a task to mark it as completed. The task will be visually distinguished with a strike-through.

Delete Task: Click on the 'x' button next to a task to delete it from the list.
